# Time_Table_Scheduler
Developed an automated timetable scheduler for 7 courses at SRM University AP using GNU Prolog. Modeled the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) to handle conflicts, time preferences, breaks, and constraints like consecutive hours and restricted time windows, reducing manual effort and errors.
